# GoTiger! üêØ

## Overviews

GoTiger! is a 2D side-scrolling game that we hope will entertain users to no end. We wanted to build this type of game because we were inspired by how successful 2D side-scrollers are. Flappy Bird is a great example of a simple 2D side-scroller that entertained millions of people. We hope to accomplish the same thing with our launch of GoTiger!. To differentiate our game from all other side-scrollers, we will stick to a Mizzou Tigers theme in every aspect of the game. This includes a picture of Jesse Hall, Mizzou‚Äôs alma mater as the background music, and Truman the Tiger as our playable hero.
 
## Concept

The game will feature Truman the Tiger as our hero traversing the map. He will start on one of the columns and his goal is to make it from column to column to reach the highest score possible. When the user holds their finger on the screen, this generates a bridge that will build vertically as long as the user keeps his/her finger on the screen. Once the user lets go, the bridge then stops growing and falls forward onto the next column. If the end of the bridge does not land perfectly on the next column, Truman will fall off and the game will end; however, if the user stops at the right time then Truman will continue onwards to a new high score.
